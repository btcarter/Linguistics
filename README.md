# Structural Template Construction for the Skilled Reading Study
This is a fork of the scripts used for building the template and priors for the paper "Carter, B. T., Foster, B., Muncy, N., & Luke, S. G. (2019). Linguistic networks associated with lexical, semantic and syntactic predictability in reading: A fixation-related fMRI study. NeuroImage. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.018" project.

This fork was started so I could learn how Muncy created the structural model for our paper and then do it again myself. As a result, a bit of a mess will ensue until further notice.
